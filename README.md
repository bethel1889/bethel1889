# 👋 Hi, I'm Ibeagha Bethel Emmanuel

### Software Developer | AI Enthusiast | Automation Expert

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer and AI enthusiast, currently working at TT Consulting Services Ltd on a renewable contract. I specialize in building automation solutions and web applications that drive efficiency and innovation. With a strong foundation in backend technologies, I aim to build scalable and robust systems that make life easier for both developers and users.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

As a **Full-Stack Developer**, I focus on creating efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions using modern technologies. My strength lies in **backend development** where I use **Python**, frameworks like **Flask**, **FastAPI**, and tools like **Docker** to deploy systems on cloud-based infrastructure. I am also proficient in **Selenium** for automation.

At **TT Consulting Services Ltd**, I'm currently **rebuilding the entire web application from the ground up**, ensuring a seamless user experience and incorporating automation solutions to streamline appointment scheduling and document processing.

While I specialize in the backend, I also handle **frontend development** with **basic HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, and React**. My frontend knowledge is solid enough to build user interfaces, but I consider myself a **backend-first developer**.

In addition to my work at TT Consulting, I'm also taking on personal projects like **CS50W**, as well as **rebuilding TT Consulting Services Ltd**. I'm excited about new opportunities and am **open to full-time roles** in **backend web development**.
